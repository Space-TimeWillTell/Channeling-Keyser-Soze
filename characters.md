# Creating Characters

All good things start with stories. It's not just a buzzphrase, by the way.
If you are building a story, whether you are role-playing, storytelling for
an audience or writing a book, the story comes first and everything else
tends to follow naturally.

So let us start with, once again, a story.

Our story is set in a fantasy archipelago inhabited by dozens of sentient
species, and loosely inspired from Ancient Greece, with larger ships.
One by one, the islands have fallen to the powerful and evil Spartan
Legion, whose overlord now rules the archipelago nearly uncontested.

So far, these are a few sentences that most GMs could improv before coffee.
We'll see more about improvising campaigns and settings
[in the dedicated chapter](campaigns.md). For the moment, we're only
interested in major NPCs, so we'll let the story flow without much
detail and concentrate only in the introduction of these NPCs.

Our first player arrives. The GM tells him about the archipelago, the
Spartan Legion, the war.

- GM: "So, what kind of character would you like to play?"
- Player 1: "Mmmh... Well, obviously, a future hero. I don't know much
    about the setting yet. so let's start with someone who's not involved
    in the war at all. Maybe some kind of farmer's kid, eager for adventure.
    I'll call him Desmondos."

Facts established:
- **Desmondos doesn't know much about the war**
- **Desmondos grew up on a farm**
- **Desmondos is eager for adventure**


- GM: "Alright. This story is going to be about you, and the other PCs,
    taking an active part in the war against the Spartan Legion.
    Desmondos, can you tell me how you *enter this plot*?"
- Desmondos: "Could I receive a message accidentally? Some magical
    message that's meant for an enemy of the Spartan Legion, who
    hides on the same island as me, but for some reason, I got the
    message, and since I'm eager for adventure, I decide to bring
    it to the intended recipient?"
- GM: "That sound good. Player 3 told me that she wants to play
    some kind of princess. Let's say it's from her. It will create
    the first relationship between your characters. Once Player 3
    arrives, we'll see later how she gets drawn into that plot.
    I don't know how she wants to call her character, but let's
    say Erikaia. We'll change the names retroactively if she
    doesn't like it."
- Desmondos: "Yeah, I received a message from Princess Erikaia."
- GM: "Ok, now tell me more about this message."
- Desmondos: "Well, it seems to be encrypted somehow. But it's clearly meant
    for a general, an enemy of the Spartan Legion, who hides on this island."
- GM: "Sounds good. I'll need a name for this general."
- Desmondos: "General Gregorios, of the Free Company."

Facts established:
- **The Free Company fights the Spartan Legion**
- **General Gregorios, of the Free Company, hides on this island**

After a few adventures, Desmondos manages to locate General
Gregorios.

- GM: "So, tell me more about this General Gregorios."
- Desmondos: "He's in his fifties and he's some kind of Paladin. He's very strong, too."
- GM: "Ok. General Gregorios tells you a bit more about the Spartan Legion – basically
    what we had established during campaign creation. Also, it's lead by a general
    called... Drakon the Undefeated."
- Desmondos: "Oh, and can Gregorios take me as an apprentice? I want to become a Paladin like him!"
- GM: "Gregorios smiles at your requests and answers '*Well, you have certainly proven worthy. We can give it a try.*""

The GM ponders it a second, and decides that since Gregorios is clearly
much stronger than Desmondos – and all threats should be scaled for
Desmondos and his friends rather than for Gregorios – Gregorios doesn't
need a character sheet. If necessary, Gregorios may be used as a *bonus*
to make things possible or improve the results of Desmondos' actions.
Not creating the character sheet immediately means that the GM is free
to improvise the exact strength and powers of Gregorios as the story
evolves, and to tailor it to wherever the story leads.

Facts established:
- **General Gregorios is in his fifties.**
- **General Gregorios is some kind of Paladin.**
- **General Gregorios is much stronger than the heroes.**
- **General Gregorios is now the mentor of Desmondos.**
- **There's a General Drakon the Undefeated of the Spartan Legion.**

Once decyphered, the message tells of a terrible threat,
some kind of spell that will forever erase freewill from
the mind of all inhabitants of the archipelago. General
Gregorios is the last hope of the Free Company and the
archipelago. Gregorios and Desmondos decide that they
need a ship to reach the hidden camp of the Free Company,
to warn them of the terrible danger.

Facts established:
- **The Spartan Legion is about to unleash a terrible spell**

Oh, Player 2 has just arrived!

- Player 2: "Sorry about that, I hope you guys started without me!"
- GM: "We certainly did. Desmondos, do you wish to tell Player 2
    about what has happened so far?"
- Desmondos: [...]
- GM: "... and so, we arrive to the moment where the heroes are
    looking for a way to leave the island and reach the hidden
    camp of the Free Company. Does this give you ideas for a
    character?"
- Player 2: "Yeah. Could I be some kind of mercenary... no, say
    a smuggler? I have my own ship, it's small, it's fast, it
    can get around the islands quickly and unseen."
- GM: "That would certainly work. So, your plot introduction is
    that you're going to be hired to bring the other heroes to
    their destination, right?"
- Player 2: "Right. And they don't have money with them, so I'm
    going to stick with them until they pay me, because I have
    debts. Also, it's a good way for me to get out of the way,
    because someone might be after me to break my knees or
    something."
- GM: "Sounds good. Do you have a name?"
- Player 2: "Mmmmh... Frankos the Sailor."

Facts established:
- **Frankos the Sailor has a small and fast ship.**
- **Frankos the Sailor has debts.**
- **Frankos the Sailor has a contract with Gregorios and Desmondos.**

After more adventures, all three characters find themselves
hidden in the hold of Drakon the Undefeated's own ship.
Right on time, Player 3 arrives.

- Player 3: "Sorry guys, I told you I'd arrive a bit late. Did you
    keep me Princess Erikaka, as I asked?"
- GM: "Yes, we did. Player 1, Player 2, can you tell her about
    what has happened so far?"
- [...]
- Player 3, now Erikaia: "Ok, then it's simple. I'm prisoner in that ship!"
- GM: "Tell me more, why are you held prisoner?"
- Erikaia: "Well, I'm one of the leaders of the Anti-Spartan Legion..."
- Desmondos: "We decided to call it the Free Company."
- Erikaia: "Ok, I'm one of the leaders of the Free Company. Also, I got word
    from a terrible threat..."
- Desmondos: "Oh, we got that one, too. There's a freewill-wiping spell,
    and the Spartan Legion is going to launch it soon."
- Erikaia: "Er... right. So, the bad guy..."
- Desmondos: "... General Drakon the Undefeated!"
- Erikaia: "You're annoying. No, his boss, The Demagogue, ordered me arrested."
- GM: "Sure. You managed to somehow send a message to General Gregorios before
    being arrested, with details about that spell."

Facts established:
- **Erikaia is prisoner in Drakon's ship**
- **Erikaia is one of the leaders of the Free Company**
- **Drakon the Undefeated's boss is called The Demagogue**


Erikaia, Desmondos and Frankos manage to remain hidden but General Gregorios
isn't so lucky. He's somehow separated from the PCs, who can only witness
from afar as Drakon the Undefeated shows up.

- GM: "It's Drakon. You recognize him easily from the description given
    by Erikaia. He's strong, he wears a mask, and he seems to be the
    same kind of Paladin as General Gregorios."

Facts established:
- **Drakon the Undefeated wears a mask**
- **Drakon the Undefeated is also some kind of Paladin, like General Gregorios**


After a short battle, General Gregorios is mercilessly executed by Drakon
the Undefeated, while the heroes manage to escape the ship.

Facts established:
- **Drakon the Undefeated is über-badass**

Frankos the Sailor manages to bring Princess Erikaia
and Desmondos to the Free Company. Ensues a discussion on
battle tactics, led by Princess Erikaia and the leader
of the Free Company.

- GM: "One second, Erikaia. Tell me something about the leader of the Free Company."
- Erikaia: "She's called Myra Medea. Also, she's dressed in white."

Facts established:
- **Myra Medea is the leader of the Free Company**;
- **Myra Medea dresses in white**.

After debate, the conclusion is that the only way to save
the archipelago is to send several groups of the Free
Company – including the PCs – to board Drakon's ship,
carrying counterspells, hoping that one will be able
to apply one of these counterspells to the pentagram
that will be used to carry out the spell. Of course,
the attack must be launched immediately.

Big battle ensues. Drakon the Undefeated illustrates his strength
by killing dozens of unnamed NPCs (since Drakon the Undefeated
has been established to be so very powerful, the GM and players
conspire to tell how he always has something more important
to do than chasing the PCs). Eventually, once most friendly NPCs
are dead, Drakon the Undefeated decides to attack the PCs, but
an explosion throws him overboard.

The counterspell is launched, the spell is averted, everybody rejoices,
and Drakon swears revenge.

Congratulation, heroes!

As for you, reader, you may have realized a few things:
- the major NPCs of this story (Drakon, Gregorios, the Demagogue, Myra Medea)
    didn't need much in terms of character creation;
- with a few tricks, the GM managed to entirely avoid character sheets
    for these characters;
- most of the creation for the characters was actually done by the players,
    rather than the GM;
- you already know this story.

Oh, yes, did we forgot to mention it? We should thank our actors, who
    came specially from *Star Wars* Episode IV to take the exact same
    roles in this antique variants:
- Luke Skywalker (as Desmondos);
- Princess Leia (as Princess Erikaia);
- Obi-Wan Kenobi (as General Gregorios);
- Darth Vader (as Drakon the Undefeated);
- Han Solo (as Frankos the Sailor);
- Emperor Palpatine (as the Demagogue);
- Senator Mon Mothma (as Myra Medea);
- ...

## The Spartan Legion Strikes Back

The story is not over, of course. Eventually, Drakon the Undefeated will manage
to trick Princess Erikaia and Frankos the Sailor into a trap and lure Desmondos
the, er, Hoplites of Light into a hopeless fight.

As our example is a Role-Playing Game, this scene may now go two ways. Either it
can become a by-the-book round-by-round combat, or the GM and Players may come
up with something a bit more inventive. In fact, since Drakon is so much stronger
than Desmondos, a by-the-book combat scene would probably be rather boring, with
Desmondos' player rolling attack after attack, only for them to be deflected by
a Drakon who could certainly kill Desmondos in a single half-hearted blow.

So, let's be a little more inventive.

- GM: "I have bad news for you, Desmondos. Drakon is really, really, really much
    stronger than you. You don't stand a chance."
- Desmondos: "Er... right. Should I create a new character?"
- GM: "Not quite yet. We're going to tell together how you fail to beat Desmondos,
    but he won't kill you. Perhaps you'll be captured, as Erikaia and Frankos, or
    perhaps you'll manage to escape, I don't know yet, but let's face it, you have
    no way of actually beating Drakon."
- Desmondos: "Oh, right. Escaping or being captured, sure, that sounds good. Do
    I get to pick now?"
- GM: "Well, you can, if you – as a player – have a strong preference, but otherwise,
    we'll see as the scene progresses."
- Desmondos: "Sounds good. Should I roll for attacks?"
- GM: "Doesn't sound really useful, but you can describe your attacks, and how
    Drakon evades or deflects them. But in fact, this scene is more a conversation
    with the swordfighting as a bit of background noise, rather than a traditional
    fight scene."
- Desmondos: "YOU WILL NEVER GET ME, DRAKON!"
- GM as Drakon: "Oh, but I will, young Hoplites. My master, the Demagogue, has
    foreseen it"
- ...

As usual, it would be surprising if this exact dialog took place during a Storytelling
performance or a Writing session, but the reasoning applies just as well to either case.

- Desmondos: "I know that you killed my father, General Gregorios told me!"



## Character creation as a bunch of Questions

---

As an exercise, you could try and check just exactly how much
character creation is required for all these major characters
in *Star Wars* Episodes V and VI.

During these two movies, very few additional Facts are
established on these characters. Giving Darth Vader a full
character sheet would make sense in Episodes V and VI,
for the fights against Luke Skywalker,
but is by no mean a necessity: in Episode V, Darth Vader is
so much stronger than Luke that getting Luke to survive pretty
means requires ignoring the character sheet or the fight rules,
while in Episode VI, Luke is so much stronger that the fight
is a mere formality.

In other words, if you wish, you can very much get away
with only a few (improvised) Facts for any of these major NPCs
of *Star Wars*. The same goes for Sauron, Saroumane and the Council
in *Lord of the Rings*, Talia or Bane in *The Dark Knight Rises*,
etc.

Let us take a look at what we have done to make this possible:
1. Avoid creating major NPCs before the story starts.
2. Create these NPCs one Fact at a time, with the help
    of the Players and/or the Space·Time Deck.
3. If a NPC is much stronger than the heroes, encounter scenes
    are largely about *avoiding* them, which is better done through
    improv than through rules.
4. By treating major NPCs as *scenes* and *obstacles* or *helpers*,
    rather than statistics, we may entirely skip any formal character
    creation.
5. By introducing a major NPC simply by his/her name, without any
    detail, we have actually heightened the impact of the NPC on
    the story.



---

So, your characters are about to meet that Ambassador of the
Qfew'dhi Confederation, and you have no clue what a Qfew'dhi
even means. Or they are going to be introduced to Temporary
People's Representative of the Floating Commune, and you have
no clue what that role entails. Or they are simply hitting
the library, or the local temple, or the tavern, for the fifth
time this session, for more details about that Screaming Demon,
and you'd like them to actually meet someone interesting. Or
maybe they have followed that kid pickpocket and stumbled upon
the Orphanage, and you have no clue what that Orphanage is,
but there must be some kind of Orphanage Ringmaster in it.

Or maybe you are a Player and the GM has just asked you to
tell her more about your cousin Janice, the one you infected
with that Psy-Virus during the first hours of Event 0. Or
you decided to summon a Familiar from the 15th Dimension,
and you just realized that you're going to need to give
it a few personality traits and, who knows, maybe even a
description!

Or maybe you're in the middle of a storytelling session,
and Sheherazade has decided to nest yet another story
inside a story, and she needs a new antagonist.

Life is hard, isn't it? But that's also what makes it fun.

Let's see how we can make it easier, while keeping the fun in.

## Nemeses and other Major NPCs

For this section, imagine the following setting.


------------------------

**FIXME** Could we find a good story support for creating two good
NPCs (one friendly, one baddy), piece-wise?


## Minor NPCs

We'll call a minor NPC a secondary character with whom you're
presumably only ever going to have simple interactions. That
guy from the forge, who's busy repairing your equipment and
might be bothered to barter with you for a moment. That woman
from the library, who has been helpful so far, but might
eventually grow fed up with your questions on non-Euclidian
tentacle-spaces. The constable who was first responder at
the crime scene and may, or may not have found anything
interesting.

One thing to remember before you actually start creating a NPC is
that, maybe, you might actually *not need to create it at all*.
As for everything else in a story, chances are that your players
(or audience, or readers) might not really care about that
elusive appearance of a random person in the street.

As is always the case, creation of a NPC starts by asking
meaningful questions. Let's start with the following
questions:

1. Do I actually need to create that NPC?
2. Would it be interesting to reuse a NPC that the heroes have already met?

By all means, don't forget this second question. The pub drunkard
is probably entirely uninteresting, and seeing a smithy is a
common occurrence in the village. However, realizing that the
smithy is yesterday's drunkard and still smells of boose
suddenly adds spice to the forge – and paves the way for
an accident that the heroes are going to witness.

Similarly, if the constable turns out to also be yesterday's friendly
woman from the library, this one-character-counts-double becomes much
more remarkable than each of its components. The players or readers
will now expect something more from this library/constable, which
means that you, as a GM or Storyteller, have a base upon which to
build.

Or, of course, this dead body might turn out to be yesterday's
drunkard, this morning's smithy, this afternoon's helpful woman in
the library, or the sister of this evening's constable. Again,
with such reuse, you have a base upon which to build.


3. What do I want the NPC to be?


For a minor NPC, chances are that you already know the answer:
- the smithy;
- the librarian;
- the constable;
- the tavern's drunkard;
- ...

In some cases, the level of detail you have in mind might not be sufficient:
- the person sitting next to you in the subway;
- the previous client of the shop;
- the sleeping owner of the house the characters picked randomly for robbing;
- ...

Let's pick that last one as an example and see if the Space·Time Deck can help: *Who owns this house?*

![](assets/small_card_12.png)

The "defenseless" part goes along with the idea that the owner is sleeping,
which doesn't help us much. With "Playing protector", on the other hand, wouldn't it be fun if
the owner was someone with close ties to the police? If the characters picked
a rich house, it could be the Empire's High Judge. Or, if it was a poorer house,
Constable Bob (retired).

We now know who we want the NPC to be. If you have just established an identity,
as above, you probably want to officially establish it as a Fact. It will come
useful very soon:
- **Owner: Constable Bob (retired).**

FIXME:
- What do I want the NPC to be?
- Where is the NPC right now?
- What is the NPC doing right now?
- What does the NPC look like?
- What does the NPC sound like?
- What does the NPC want?
- What does the NPC want to avoid?
- What does the NPC hide?

## About random tables

TBD

## Dealing with inconsistencies

TBD

An inconsistency *is* a question.

## What have we done and seen?

TBD

## Exercise time

1. Pick a movie of book of your choice.
2. Pick one of the major support characters, good, bad or other.
3. Determine what is the actual amount of Facts established on that character, and when that information is given.
4. Pick an instant when a Fact is established on that character. Find out what Question it answers.
5. Draw a card from the Space·Time Deck to answer that Question and come up with a different answer and set of Facts.
6. Try and see how this would affect the rest of the story.

# Creating a NPC

So, your characters are about to meet that Ambassador of the
Qfew'dhi Confederation, and you have no clue what a Qfew'dhi
even means. Or they are going to be introduced to Temporary
People's Representative of the Floating Commune, and you have
no clue what that role entails. Or they are simply hitting
the library, or the local temple, or the tavern, for the fifth
time this session, for more details about that Screaming Demon,
and you'd like them to actually meet someone interesting. Or
maybe they have followed that kid pickpocket and stumbled upon
the Orphanage, and you have no clue what that Orphanage is,
but there must be some kind of Orphanage Ringmaster in it.

Or maybe you are a Player and the GM has just asked you to
tell her more about your cousin Janice, the one you infected
with that Psy-Virus during the first hours of Event 0. Or
you decided to summon a Familiar from the 15th Dimension,
and you just realized that you're going to need to give
it a few personality traits and, who knows, maybe even a
description!

Or maybe you're a Writer, and you need to do all of this,
at once.

Life is hard, isn't it? But that's also what makes it fun.

Let's see how we can make it easier, while keeping the fun in.

NPC) needs a fully detailed character sheet. Needless to say,
spending 10-20 minutes deep in your books fleshing out the
attributes and skills of a NPC is not something that goes very
well with maintaining the pace of the game.

details along this chapter, but the general idea is that you
can pretty much delay numeric NPC creation for as long as you
need to.




## Minor NPCs

We'll call a minor NPC a secondary character with whom you're
presumably only ever going to have simple interactions. That
guy from the forge, who's busy repairing your equipment and
might be bothered to barter with you for a moment. That woman
from the library, who has been helpful so far, but might
eventually grow fed up with your questions on non-Euclidian
tentacle-spaces. The constable who was first responder at
the crime scene and may, or may not have found anything
interesting.

One thing to remember before you actually start creating a NPC is
that, maybe, you might actually *not need to create it at all*.
As for everything else in a story, chances are that your players
(or audience, or readers) might not really care about that
elusive appearance of a random person in the street.

**FIXME** More.

Let's start with that random person on the street.


### What do I want the NPC to be?

As with pretty much everything in this book, creating a NPC starts with formulating
a question. In most cases, this question is *What do I want the NPC to be?*

For a minor NPC, chances are that you already know the answer:
- the smithy;
- the librarian;
- the constable;
- the tavern's drunkard;
- ...

In some cases, the level of detail you have in mind might not be sufficient:
- the person sitting next to you in the subway;
- the previous client of the shop;
- the sleeping owner of the house the characters picked randomly for robbing;
- ...

Let's pick that last one as an example and see if the Space·Time Deck can help: *Who owns this house?*

![](assets/small_card_12.png)

The "defenseless" part goes along with the idea that the owner is sleeping,
which doesn't help us much. With "Playing protector", on the other hand, wouldn't it be fun if
the owner was someone with close ties to the police? If the characters picked
a rich house, it could be the Empire's High Judge. Or, if it was a poorer house,
Constable Bob (retired).

We now know who we want the NPC to be. If you have just established an identity,
as above, you probably want to officially establish it as a Fact. It will come
useful very soon:
- **Owner: Constable Bob (retired).**

### What is the NPC doing right now?

We now have an idea of who we want the NPC to be. If the NPC is not in front of the
characters, it's time

Pretty clearly, the NPC is
in front of the characters.


### Where is the NPC right now?

**FIXME** Useless, right?

Our second question is *Where is the NPC at this instant?* Again, in most cases,
you already know the answer: *just in front of the characters* or a variant
thereof – or, it could also be *on the phone*, or *somewhere in the astral plane*,
in case of remote communication.

## Nemeses and other Major NPCs

### Quicker, easier, more seductive – the Improv Side is

Do you remember what we wrote earlier about not creating a
minor NPC until and unless you need to? Well, the same
applies to most major NPCs.

Consider, for instance, *Lord of the Rings*. While Sauron's
presence permeates most of the books and movies, how many
times does Sauron show himself during the course of the quest?
Only once, and then briefly, at the very end, and not long
enough to actually do anything. When confronted with the
Fellowship of the Ring, *Sauron doesn't do anything that
deserves a character sheet*.

What about Emperor Palpatine or Supreme Leader Snoke,
in the Star Wars universe? If you assume that the PCs
are Luke, Leia, Lando, Han, Chewbacca, Emperor Palpatine
appears only once, and then briefly, at the very end,
and only long enough to deliver a few lightning strikes
and a half-hearted offer for Luke to change side. If you
assume that the PCs are Rey, Finn, Poe and Rose, again,
you only get a single short appearance (as of this writing),
barely long enough for that character to even deserve an
actor, much less a character sheet.

Well, that's not entirely fair. Yes, Sauron, Palpatine
or Snoke need *some* character creation:
- they need the means of their ambitions (early in the story, but may be revisited later);
- they need an ambition (actually later in the story than the means);
- they need a name (but only during the second half of the story);
- they need a face (but only during the last five minutes of the story);
- they might need some kind of power or signature move (but only during the last two minutes).

But again, nothing that deserves a full character sheet.

In fact, experience shows that you only ever need a character sheet
for your big baddie if you want to set this baddie as a big boss in some
kind of final confrontation – whether it's a fisticuff, a cosmic chess
game, or an attempt for each to convince the other that they're wrong.
And even then, in most cases, that's nothing that requires a full
character sheet.

In other words, yes, you can very much improv a Sauron, a Palpatine
or a Snoke with a few questions and notes.

Now, what about a Darth Vader? Can you improv a Darth Vader?

Let's take a step back and discuss what Darth Vader is.

1. Darth Vader is:
    - a powerful adversary;
    - initially (Episode VI-V), he's much too powerful for the heroes, who may only be saved through sacrifice (Obi Wan), luck (Han Solo) or jumping into the void (Luke);
    - eventually, once the heroes have levelled up, he can easily be defeated.
2. Darth Vader is:
    - a powerful series of obstacles;
    - initially (Episode VI-V), these obstacles may only be overcome through sacrifice (Obi Wan), luck (Han Solo) or jumping into the void (Luke);
    - eventually, once the story has progressed, he's not the obstacle anymore.

Which one do you think describes Vader best? One may argue that
both are equally valid. But one major difference, in terms of
improv, is that the first one needs a character sheet, while
the second doesn't. Also, since there are very few non-improv-oriented
rulesets that offer space for sacrifice, luck and jumping into
the void, in either case, *we end up ignoring Darth Vader's character sheet*.

So yes, Darth Vader can very much be an improv target.

The lessons from this lengthy discussion are the following:
- even boss-like figures can be improvised piece-wise;
- even boss-like figures don't necessarily need a real character sheet;
- in other words, improv works even for them.

### What about the good guys?

### Let's improv some major characters!

**FIXME** Or maybe we should get started with this, and improv Palpatine and Darth Vader as we go?

TBD

The questions:
- what does the NPC look like;
- what is the NPC doing right now;
- what does the NPC want;
- what does the NPC want to avoid.

## Dealing with inconsistencies

An inconsistency *is* a question.

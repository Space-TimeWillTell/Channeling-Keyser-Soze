# Back cover

Oops, the players have ruined the story, again. They managed to get Camelot invaded by the peaceful Seelie while King Arthur was at war, to kill teenage Karl Marx while vacationing in Space·Time or to blow up the Magical University where the entire campaign was meant to take place. Also, they have just entered the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death, for which you have no maps, or they are due to meet the Ambassador of the Qfew'dhi Confederation, the one you just invented by pushing random keys on your keyboard.

And they want more.

Guess it's time to switch to improv mode!

**How will King Arthur Pendragon react to news of the invasion?**

**How will history readjust itself without Karl Marx?**

**How will the Unseen Council protect the Mundane Sphere without the Sevenfold Anchor?**

**What evil lurks in the Unknowable Dungeon of Unspeakable Death?**

**What does a Qfew'dhi even look like?**

This book knows! The Space·Time Deck knows!

*(well, or at least, they can help you improvise an answer)*

This product is meant to cover all your Space·Time needs! It comes with examples for improvising characters on-the-fly, exploring dungeons without maps, describing fights and altercations and pursuits and confrontations of all sorts, but also coming up with planets, alien species, past and future threats, and world lore.

If you are a GM, a Player, a Storyteller or a Writer, we have something for you. The book will teach you improv techniques for coming up with entire stories and story elements without breaking pace, and the Tarot-like Space·Time Deck will become one of your best creative friends!

**Warning** Some of the illustrations involve violence or (limited) nudity. Nothing worse than what you could see in a museum, but you may wish to review the cards before putting them in the hands of children.

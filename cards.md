# The Space·Time Deck

The most visible tool introduced in the tutorial is the Space·Time Deck.
This Deck is loosely inspired from the Major Arcanes (aka the Trump Cards)
of a Divination Tarot and is meant to be used essentially in the same way:
to help you focus on a question that may have an unlimited number of
possible answers and use symbols to lead you in the search for one of
these answers.

Tarot-like decks have been used in role-playing games at least since 1995,
with *Everway* and its dearly missed Fortune Deck. Some of the authors
of this book have been authoring and using Tarot-like decks for nearly 20
years now. Where *Everway* used
its deck in lieu of dice, for narrative action resolution, most GMs
will content themelves with using the Space·Time Deck for inspiration,
in addition of their usual ruleset. Should you wish to actually use
the Space·Time Deck for action resolution, we have you covered in
chapter [Replacing your usual ruleset with the deck](rules.md).

## Why cards?

In theory, a GM or Player or Writer should be able to use anything
around them as support for improvisation, anything they see or hear
or remember. In fact, the ideal improviser is *Usual Suspects*'
Keyser Söze, who manages to come up with a plot twist just by
looking at his coffee cup.

Sadly, most of us aren't Keyser Söze. We have ideas, many of them,
all the time, but we typically have so many of them tha it's hard
for us to concentrate pick one, focus on it, and develop it until
it actually becomes a good idea.

So we need to focus. While on stage, improv actors focus on the
topic or constraints of the improv and on
actors around them, ignoring the rest of the universe. Around a
table, or at a writing table, the problem remains the same, but
the situation is different – where most improv acts last only
a few minutes, or at most ninety minutes, typical gaming sessions
last at least 4 hours with no breaks, and hundreds of pages worth
of rulebooks, plots, character sheets and modules on the table.
Writing takes months or years during which too much focus
`MAKES JACK A DULL BOY`.

Looking at one card is one way to focus your thoughts, for just
a few seconds, by forcing yourself to express your thoughts in
relationship to this card. Focus helps you pick one single idea
from the mass teeming in your brain, which
is what you need to make that story interesting and fun!

## A look at the cards

Since we're going to use the cards, let's take a good lock at them.

If this is how you read rules, you may safely consider this section
as a reference guide, skimming it for the moment, and returning to
it whenever you want to double-check something from the rest of the
book.


### I. The Big Bang

![](/assets/small_horizontal_card_1.png)

Default interpretations:
- Overwhelming force?
- Something new is born?

The Big Bang is the current best scientific theory for a beginning to
the universe. The Big Bang itself is described by scientists as the
instant before the beginning of time, space, light or matter.

The white on this card may symbolize purity, or a blinding
light, or simply the color white.

#### Example: The temple.

The characters enter some kind of temple. *What do they see?*

Drawing the Big Bang:

- Either side
    - there doesn't seem to be anyone in the temple, but they feel the divine presence, radiating in this place;
    - there doesn't seem to be anyone in the temple, and somehow, the divine presence that they expected is... missing;
    - oh, look, they're celebrating a marriage!
- Overwhelming Force
    - the presence of the divine is so strong in this temple that it's almost physically tangible, making every movement difficult;
    - this cult is obviously extremely rich, you can feel it in the golden ornaments, the tapestries, the glassworks, the heavy incense;
    - all the villagers are standing, silent, many of them mouth agape, while they listen to the preacher – he's a powerful presence, a powerful orator, and he's carrying a powerful message... Let's draw a second card to find out which one, exactly!
- Something new is born
    - there's some kind of big commotion in the church, men are being shooed away and sent to fetch hot water and clean clothes, oh, it looks like a woman has entered labor right in the middle of the temple;
    - apparently, it's some kind of silent celebration of whatever local tradition introduces either babies or teenagers into the local community (say, a baptism, circumcision, etc.);
    - the temple is mostly empty, except for two old men discussing in the back – their discussion seems to be somewhat animated, they gesticulate a lot, and you overhear something about the Earth being round. That sounds like blasphemy.

#### Example: The desolate island.

The characters are stranded on a desolate island. *What do they see on the horizon?*

Drawing the Bing Bang:

- Either side:
    - they see nothing, but the force of the sun, and the immense
      isolation of the sea (GM decides to advance the story by a
      few days while they despair);
- Overwhelming Force:
    - the sun, their thirst is crushing the characters, they need to
        find water and some kind of refuge away from the sun;
    - the tide is rising – oh, the tide seems to be rising a lot,
        is that the reason for the moss all over the island?
    - there seems to be some kind of storm on the horizon, and it
        is either growing or coming this way;
    - look, that's the fleet of Dread Pirate Roberts, the one you
        were hired to stop, they are passing by the island,
        and if you can believe your eyes, it's even stronger
        than what you were told
        (the characters might be able to get their attention
        or swim towards one of the ships).
- Something new is born:
    - it seems to be birth season for some birds on the island
        you hear the chirps of all these newborn birds and you
        see their parents flying towards prey
        (the GM adds, both as a threat and as a suggestion to
        help the characters escape, that these are *giant* birds);
    - it starts with the earth shaking, but now, you clearly
        see some kind of green light coming out of a hole in
        the ground – and there's something very large below
        (what is it? I'm sure you have ideas, but you can
        draw another card, if you wish)

#### Example: The space station.

The characters have finally managed to open a security door on a space
    station. *What do they find on the other side?*

- Either side:
    - there is absolutely nothing on the other side – apparently, the bad
        guys seems to have packed meticulously and left – maybe the unmovable
        station terminals know more about it;
    - there is a white room, dedicated to assembling highly dangerous
        components, two shape dressed in white suits are hunched over
        something very delicate-looking, they haven't seen you yet;
    - this is some kind of laboratory, full of equipment you do not understand,
        and people focused on their terminals.
        In the center, a large glass column seems to be holding in suspension
        some form of matter that is so dark and odd that just watching at it
        makes your eyes hurt. There's a large countdown on top of the column:
        "Big Bang minus seven hours".
- Overwhelming force:
    - apparently, it's the central reactor – it's a bit strange that it was not
        clearly labelled as such, isn't it? Also, this reactor seems to be odd,
        you aren't entirely sure, but it seems to be powered by...
        let's ask a second question to the Space·Time Deck;
    - this is it, your instruments clearly indicate that this is the source for
        the galactic tide that you have been searching for the entire story. It's
        in that room, about three feet in front of you. How comes you see absolutely
        nothing in that white room?
- Something new is born:
    - you enter a large hangar, full of cages, themselves full of odd creatures
        from all over space. You're pretty sure that some of these creatures are
        sentient. A crew of five hulkish figures is going round the cages, using
        some kind of cattle prod to keep the figures away while they collect eggs...
        and babies, too, apparently.
    - this is clearly some kind of lab, a maze full of apparatus, and full of corpses
        of odd-shaped creatures floating in jars. You can see labels: "Experiment
        17 – failure", "Experiment 2048 - failure"... At some point, while
        exploring the maze, you stumble upon "Experiment 31415 – success – seeded on Sol 3".
        It seems to hold a human being.

### II. We were having so much fun!

![](/assets/small_horizontal_card_2.png)

TBD

#### Example: King Arthur

King Arthur is away with his army and knights battling Sir Medraut. He left the
characters in charge of watching the realm during the few weeks that he's expecting
to stay away. However, the characters have somehow managed to provoke the generally
peaceful Sidhe to war, and they haev invaded the defenseless Camelot.
*How does King Arthur react to the news of the invasion?*

- Ignoring the world:
    - King Arthur was wounded during the battle. He's lying unconscious in his tent,
        and none of the healers was able to wake him up.
    - The spies of Sir Medraut managed to intercept the messenger and the message.
        King Arthur knows nothing of the invasion, but Sir Medraut does and will
        act upon this piece of information. You probably want to draw a second
        card to find out what Sir Medraut is planning.
- Innocence:
    - King Arthur knows of the peaceful ways of the Sidhe. He refuses to believe that
        such innocent, fun-loving creatures would hurt Camelot in any way. In fact, he
        would rather believes that either the messenger is a liar, or that the
        characters are conspiring with Medraut and against him.
    - As the messenger arrived to the encampment of King Arthur's army, what he saw
        was anything but an army. Naked soldiers everywhere, enjoying the summer, the
        fruits and each other's flesh. The messenger fled this cursed place and returned
        with the news that King Arthur has been enchanted by the Sidhe!

#### Example: Meeting an informant

The characters have an appointment with Toady, one of their informants, who knows
something about the supply lines of the arms dealer. They'll meet
him behind a pub. *What do they see when they arrive in the back-alley?*

- Either side:
    - A group of teenagers high on something seem to have decided that this back alley was the
        best place to make out, or perhaps pass out, they don't seem to be quite decided yet.
        Toady is trying to remain inconspicuous at the end of the alley, and would clearly
        prefer being anywhere else than here, but he doesn't seem ready to actually step
        on the bodies to get out of there.
- Ignoring the world:
    - When you arrive, Toady is here. He's also very, very, very drunk. Not only can't you
        get anything from him, but you also can't leav him here, otherwise he might drown in
        his own vomit, or perhaps stagger back in the pub and babble to everyone about your
        planned meeting.
- Innocence:
    - When you arrive, the first thing you see is a hooded shape, who looks back at you and
        runs in fear... when you manage to catch up with him, you realize that it's not Toady,
        just a kid who had picked that back alley to smoke a joint. When you return to the
        meeting point, Toady is there, pretty nervous, but also quite happy that you made him
        wait so long.

#### Example: Getting hit by a sharp instrument

### I know it must be here somewhere

![](/assets/small_horizontal_card_0.png)

This is the only card without a number. That's by design. Make it
a beginning, or an end, or a journey through all the cards. It is
a labyrinth, full of mysteries and enigmas.

TBD


## What do we do with all these cards?

The process is very simple:

1. Shuffle the deck – don't forget that the orientation of a card may change its meaning,
    so also shuffle the orientation of the cards.
2. Formulate a question – because it's hard to think of an answer until you have a clear
    question in mind. You typically formulate the question out loud, but you don't have to.
3. Draw a card.
4. Look at the title, at the picture, at the interpretation facing you.
5. Optionally, request the input from other people around the table.
6. Explain how the card answers that question.
7. The GM may get to veto or tone down an answer, if it doesn't make sense in the setting.
8. Establish the Facts from the answer, and write them down where everybody can see them –
    don't forget that step, this will help one player easily reuse another players Facts,
    this is will help the GM or a Writer turn Facts into foreshadowing, etc.

As mentioned previously, don't look at the interpretation facing away from you.
By making the two sides to the same picture different, we both make our focus
tighter and essentially double the number of cards.

In some cases, an answer may raise more questions. If you wish answer to these
questions *right now*, repeat the process. In many cases, the answer can wait.

And that's pretty much *it*. With training, you'll get fast at this. If you are a GM or
a Player, it's ok even if you are not: as long as you involve everybody around the table,
everybody is still having fun, and it often makes a nice change of pace from your other
swashbuckling, dungeoneering, investigating activities.

> **Pace yourself**
>
> You should not draw cards *too often*. Very simply, interpreting cards is
fun, but it can also be tiring. Also, drawing cards gives you ideas, but
you can end up with *too many* good ideas, so many that you won't actually
have the opportunity to use them all.
>
> In a fight, for instance, you do not want to draw one card per exchange.
Draw cards at the start, to give flavour, but after that, keep them for a
moment when the fight seems to be repeating itself or to look
too much like the previous fight.
>
> Also, if you're a GM, by all means, make players participate, they are
supposed to come up with ideas, too!

## Are 22 cards enough?

Well, ~20 years of GM-ing with a deck seem to indicate that yes, they do.

It is true that 22 cards only means a total of 44 possible draws. You will
rather quickly run out of different draws, but that's entirely ok. As you
will see in further chapters, you are going to be able to come up with
considerably more than 44 different characters or plots or places or events.

There are a few very simple reasons for this:
1. as you improv, you establish Facts, and these Facts will introduce
    meaningful differences between answers to the same cards
1. you will learn, progressively, to formulate more detailed questions,
    which will in turn lead you to different answers with the exact
    same card;
1. whenever you find that an answer is too close to something that
    you have already come up with, you should feel free to ask followup
    questions that will introduce additional spice.

Don't worry, we'll return on each of these points in the following chapters.

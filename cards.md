# The Space·Time Deck

The most visible tool introduced in the tutorial is the Space·Time Deck.
This Deck is loosely inspired from the Major Arcanes (aka the Trump Cards)
of a Divination Tarot and is meant to be used essentially in the same way:
to help you focus on a question that may have an unlimited number of
possible answers and use symbols to lead you in the search for one of
these answers.

Tarot-like decks have been used in role-playing games at least since 1995,
with *Everway* and its dearly missed Fortune Deck. Some of the authors
of this book have been authoring and using Tarot-like decks for nearly 20
years now. Where *Everway* used
its deck in lieu of dice, for narrative action resolution, most GMs
will content themelves with using the Space·Time Deck for inspiration,
in addition of their usual ruleset. Should you wish to actually use
the Space·Time Deck for action resolution, we have you covered in
chapter [Using the deck instead of your usual ruleset](rules.md).

## Why cards?

In theory, a GM or Player or Writer should be able to use anything
around them as support for improvisation, anything they see or hear
or remember. In fact, the ideal improviser is Kayser Söze, who manages
to come up with a plot twist just by looking at his coffee cup.

Sadly, most of us aren't Kayser Söze. We have ideas, many of them,
all the time, but we typically have so many of them tha it's hard
for us to concentrate pick one, focus on it, and develop it until
it actually becomes a good idea.

So we need to focus. While on stage, improv actors focus on the
topic or constraints of the improv and on
actors around them, ignoring the rest of the universe. Around a
table, or at a writing table, the problem remains the same, but
the situation is different – where most improv acts last only
a few minutes, or at most ninety minutes, typical gaming sessions
last at least 4 hours with no breaks, and hundreds of pages worth
of rulebooks, plots, character sheets and modules on the table.
Writing takes months or years during which too much focus
`MAKES JACK A DULL BOY`.

Looking at one card is one way to focus your thoughts, for just
a few seconds, by forcing yourself to express your thoughts in
relationship to this card. Focus helps you pick one single idea
from the mass teeming in your brain, which
is what you need to make that story interesting and fun!

## A look at the cards

Since we're going to use the cards, let's take a good lock at them.

If this is how you read rules, you may safely consider this section
as a reference guide, skimming it for the moment, and returning to
it whenever you want to double-check something from the rest of the
book.


### I. The Big Bang

![](/assets/small_card_1.png)

Default interpretations:
- Overwhelming force?
- Something new is born?

The Big Bang is the current best scientific theory for a beginning to
the universe. The Big Bang itself is described by scientists as the
instant before the beginning of time, space, light or matter.

The white on this card may symbolize purity, or a blinding
light, or simply the color white.

#### Example: The temple.
The characters are in some kind of temple.

- The white picture may symbolize, for instance:
    - the divine presence (or absence, depending on the plot);
    - a marriage.
- The *overwhelming force* may be:
    - that or the divine;
    - that of its earthly church;
    - the overwhelming presence of a preacher in that church.
- *Something new is born* may be:
    - a baby being born, right now, in that churchj;
    - the introduction of faithfuls or babies to a religious mystery (say, a baptism);
    - two philosophers discussing science in the back of the temple.

#### Example: The desolate island.
The characters are on a desolate island.

- The white picture may represent, for instance:
    - their isolation;
    - the force of the sun.
- The *overwhelming force* may be:
    - thirst;
    - the tide;
    - a coming storm on the horizon;
    - the fleet that they hoped to stop, passing by the island where they are stuck.
- *Something new is born* could mean:
    - it's mating or birth season for some animals on the island, or for the whales nearby;
    - a strange phenomenon.

#### Example: The space station.

The characters have finally managed to open a security door on a space
    station. What's on the other side?

- The white picture may mean that:
    - there is absolutely nothing on the other side;
    - there is a white room, dedicated to assembling highly dangerous components
- The title *Big Bang* may suggest a laboratory trying to reproduce the conditions of the
    actual Big Bang.
- The *overwhelming force* may suggest that:
    - they have found the central reactor. What is powering the reactor may be determined
        by asking a second question to the Space·Time Deck;
    - they have found the source or a manifestation of the force that is rising like a
        tide across the galaxy and that is the entire point of the plot.
- *Something new is born* could mean that:
    - this is a lab, observing the birth of a star, or galaxy, or black hole, or cosmic creature;
    - a new species is being invented in this lab;
    - mankind has been invented in this lab.

This is the only card without a number. That's by design. Make it
a beginning, or an end, or a journey through all the cards. It is
a labyrinth, full of mysteries and enigmas.

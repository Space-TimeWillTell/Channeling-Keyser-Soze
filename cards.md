# The Space·Time Deck

The most visible tool introduced in the tutorial is the Space·Time Deck.
This Deck is loosely inspired from the Major Arcanes (aka the Trump Cards)
of a Divination Tarot and is meant to be used essentially in the same way:
to help you focus on a question that may have an unlimited number of
possible answers and use symbols to lead you in the search for one of
these answers.

Tarot-like decks have been used in role-playing games at least since 1995,
with *Everway* and its dearly missed Fortune Deck. Some of the authors
of this book have been authoring and using Tarot-like decks for nearly 20
years now. Where *Everway* used
its deck in lieu of dice, for narrative action resolution, most GMs
will content themelves with using the Space·Time Deck for inspiration,
in addition of their usual ruleset. Should you wish to actually use
the Space·Time Deck for action resolution, we have you covered in
chapter [Replacing your usual ruleset with the deck](rules.md).

## Why cards?

In theory, a GM or Player or Writer should be able to use anything
around them as support for improvisation, anything they see or hear
or remember. In fact, the ideal improviser is *Usual Suspects*'
Keyser Söze, who manages to come up with a plot twist just by
looking at his coffee cup.

Sadly, most of us aren't Keyser Söze. We have ideas, many of them,
all the time, but we typically have so many of them tha it's hard
for us to concentrate pick one, focus on it, and develop it until
it actually becomes a good idea.

So we need to focus. While on stage, improv actors focus on the
topic or constraints of the improv and on
actors around them, ignoring the rest of the universe. Around a
table, or at a writing table, the problem remains the same, but
the situation is different – where most improv acts last only
a few minutes, or at most ninety minutes, typical gaming sessions
last at least 4 hours with no breaks, and hundreds of pages worth
of rulebooks, plots, character sheets and modules on the table.
Writing takes months or years during which too much focus
`MAKES JACK A DULL BOY`.

Looking at one card is one way to focus your thoughts, for just
a few seconds, by forcing yourself to express your thoughts in
relationship to this card. Focus helps you pick one single idea
from the mass teeming in your brain, which
is what you need to make that story interesting and fun!

## Looking at one card

You can find a full description of each card in the [reference chapter](chapter.md).

For the moment, let us concentrate on one of the cards:
![/assets/horizontal_card_0.png](/assets/small_horizontal_card_0.png)

This card has:
- a title: *I know it must be here somewhere!*;
- a picture;
- two interpretations:
    - "Mysteries?";
    - "Enigmas?"

Whenever you draw a card, one of the interpretations is facing you.
To formulate your idea, you're free to use either the title, any
element in the picture, or the interpretation facing you.


### A little context

 This card represents the Ancient Greek Hero Theseus, son of Egeus,
descendent of Zeus, God of the Skies and ruler of the Gods,
 (**TBD** check) and future king of Athens,
venturing forth in the Labyrinth of Crete. In the story, the
Minean empire (which actually existed in History) rules over
Athens, and requires a tribute of seven young men and seven young
women per seven years, to feed the monstruous Minotaur.  Prince Theseus joined as one of the young
men set for sacrifice into the Labyrinth, promising to
convince the Minotaur to stop eating the youth of Athens. With the help
of his lover Princess Ariadne of Crete, he would find
and slay the Minotaur,
escape the Labyrinth, and return to Athens.
Somewhere along the way, he would betray and abandon
Princess Ariadne and semi-accidentally cause the death
of his own father, hence gaining the crown of Athens.
Needless to say, Theseus is a very ambiguous hero.

This card also represents The Minotaur, the half-man, half-bull
Monster trapped in the Labyrinth. The Minotaur is a symbol of
savage strenghts, as well as mark of the sin of Minos, king of
Crete, who failed to hold is bargain with Poseideon, God of Seas.
The Minotaur is the son of Minos' wife, Pasiphae and a divine
Bull, with some engineering help of the genius Daedalus. Finally,
the Minotaur itself was said to give strength to the Minoean
Empire, by its sheer existence.

Finally, this card represents the Labyrinth itself. An entire
palace/temple/prison, designed by the polymath genius Daedalus
to contain the Minotaur and its monstruous power, and which also
served as a jail for Daedalus and his son Icarus themselves.
The Labyrinth was where young men and women of Athens were
sent to die, consumed by the Minotaur. To escape the Labyrinth,
Daedalus invented a flying machine, and flew away with his son,
who unfortunately got to close to the Sun and fell to his death.

Whenever you attempt to come up with an Answer to a Question
using this card, you can use *any* – or *all* – of the above.

### Interpretations

Once you have a Question, the following keys can all serve to come
up with an Answer to this Question.

We'll see examples below.

- **Picture** A fearless hero, or perhaps an ambitious one. The
    Labyrinth, both a palace, a temple and a prison, as well as
    the symbol of being lost – something which can apply very
    either literally or metaphorically, as one may be lost in
    their own thoughts, or in a reading, or in an illusion,
    or in a riddle. A thread, which
    may lead one to the exit. A Monster, a power beyond that
    of mortals, who is also a victim of his birth. Also, this
    Monster seems curious. Who is this man who comes without fear?
    The bones
    of those who came before. Also, a hunt, in which it isn't
    clear who is hunting whom. Also, a sword – violence will
    be shed.
- **Enigmas** Something unexplained, but which can be puzzled out.
    A riddle, a cypher, a password, or any other way to hide the
    truth. Or perhaps a mathematical problem, or a philosophical
    one, or a police investigation. Something which may be solved
    for fun, or for dire reasons.
- **Mysteries** Something unknown, but which can be taught. Generally,
    an aspect of mysticism, hidden to the non-initiates.
    Common linked to a religion, a cult, or a secret society. By
    extension, any skill or knowledge associated to some kind
    of subculture, from geekdom to poetry, from streetslang
    to webdevelopment. Also, a metaphor, a message in a play, or a book,
    or a poem.

### Example: The new drug on the block

In a cyber setting, the characters are investigating a series of overdoses,
all of them related to some new drug called Vita. *What are the symptoms
of taking this drug?*

Let's see a few possible interpretations using this card:

- Either side:
    - Anybody who injects this drug loses consciousness. They find themselves
        lost in memories, living and reliving them over and over again. In
        these memories, the drug addicts can reshape themselseves, reimagining
        themselves are stronger, or braver, or smarter.
    - Drug addicts immediately feel themselves becoming stronger, braver, more
        cunning. They move with a new purpose, temporarily becoming creatures
        of straight ambition and power. Some become more efficient. Some turn
        into monsters. It's not always easy to tell the difference.
- Enigmas:
    - To one high on this drug, no problem is too complicated, no riddle to
        obscure. When high, a user can see patterns invisible even to the
        trained brain, and follow them to their conclusion. Enigma is commonly
        used by researchers and investigators.
    - Addicts quickly become paranoid. Whatever they know, they must hide. Any
        document they have, they encrypt. They come up with new languages and
        cyphers.
- Mysteries:
    - To partake in Vita is to become one with the Divine. To feel its thoughts,
        its envies, and to become greater than oneself. If the Voodoo masters
        of the cyberspace have taken a sudden interest in Vita, it may be because
        they are looking to transcend, or because they need to extinguish competition.
    - For a few minutes, whoever inhales Vita feels smarter. While they are high,
        they start speaking in unknown languages. Some experts, however, have
        started decyphering this language. Apparently, the Vita-addicts
        are *networking* with each other.

## What do we do with all these cards?

The process is very simple:

1. Shuffle the deck – don't forget that the orientation of a card may change its meaning,
    so also shuffle the orientation of the cards.
2. Formulate a question – because it's hard to think of an answer until you have a clear
    question in mind. You typically formulate the question out loud, but you don't have to.
3. Draw a card.
4. Look at the title, at the picture, at the interpretation facing you.
5. Optionally, request the input from other people around the table.
6. Explain how the card answers that question.
7. The GM may get to veto or tone down an answer, if it doesn't make sense in the setting.
8. Establish the Facts from the answer, and write them down where everybody can see them –
    don't forget that step, this will help one player easily reuse another players Facts,
    this is will help the GM or a Writer turn Facts into foreshadowing, etc.

As mentioned previously, don't look at the interpretation facing away from you.
By making the two sides to the same picture different, we both make our focus
tighter and essentially double the number of cards.

In some cases, an answer may raise more questions. If you wish answer to these
questions *right now*, repeat the process. In many cases, the answer can wait.

And that's pretty much *it*. With training, you'll get fast at this. If you are a GM or
a Player, it's ok even if you are not: as long as you involve everybody around the table,
everybody is still having fun, and it often makes a nice change of pace from your other
swashbuckling, dungeoneering, investigating activities.

## Making the audience participate

**TBD**

Also, if you're a GM or if you're storytelling for an audience,
the best way to draw cards is *not* to hide them. Rather, make
the players/audience aware that you are drawing a card, make it
part of the show and the suspense. And by all means, make the
players/the audience participate, they are supposed to come up with ideas, too!

## When and when not to

While the cards can add considerable variety to your sessions, you
should avoid drawing cards *too often*. The first reason is that
interpreting cards is fun, but it does involve mental effort, and
it will tire you. Don't forget to pace yourself.

The second reason is that each card will, generally, help you come
up with one or more new idea. If you draw too many cards, you simply
won't have time to use all your ideas – and you can even find yourself
drowning in too many ideas.

So, when should you draw a card? The answer, of course, depends
on the storyteller, the story being told, and the players or
audience. But a rule of thumb is:

1. Don't let the deck limit you you. If you have a great Answer
    without drawing a card, by all means, use it!
1. You can draw whenever you wish to introduce something
    brand new, such as a new character or location, or
    secret-behind-the-door, and you need some inspiration.
1. You can draw to setup a scene that you want to make stand
    out, whether it's an action scene, a description or a
    heated argument – draw once to setup that scene, then
    forget cards for a moment,
1. You can draw whenever you feel that there is a lull, or
    that the scene is getting generic – however, if you
    find yourself needing to draw more than two or three
    times, it may well be time to actually stop the scene.


## Are 22 cards enough?

Well, ~20 years of GM-ing with a deck seem to indicate that yes, they do.

It is true that 22 cards only means a total of 44 possible draws. You will
rather quickly run out of different draws, but that's entirely ok. As you
will see in further chapters, you are going to be able to come up with
considerably more than 44 different characters or plots or places or events.

There are a few very simple reasons for this:
1. as you improv, you establish Facts, and these Facts will introduce
    meaningful differences between answers to the same cards
1. you will learn, progressively, to formulate more detailed questions,
    which will in turn lead you to different answers with the exact
    same card;
1. whenever you find that an answer is too close to something that
    you have already come up with, you should feel free to ask followup
    questions that will introduce additional spice.

Don't worry, we'll return on each of these points in the following chapters.

## Exercise time!

As an exercise:
1. pick one of the questions associated to any of the cards;
2. draw a card of the Space·Time Deck;
3. interpret the question using that card and ses how you can get different results;
4. repeat 2-3 times, to grow comfortable with the process.

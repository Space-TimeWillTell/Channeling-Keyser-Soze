# Using the SpaceÂ·Time Deck instead of your usual ruleset

## General idea

- Characters are created with descriptions instead of attributes;
- Everybody draws for themselves and gets to describe what happens;
- The GM gets to say whether a description makes sense;
- Everybody, including the GM, has a few tokens to overrule a description;

TBD

## Conflicts


- One draw for each side, not for each character;
- You draw your next card as the adversary is narrating the flow of events. Once the adversary's
    flow is over, or when it makes sense that your card interrupts the adversary, you get to
    narrate, while the adversary draws a card.
- If there is no natural conclusion, the GM draws one card for the conclusion of the conflict.
- No hit points, etc.

# Using the SpaceÂ·Time Deck instead of your usual ruleset

## General idea

- Characters are created with descriptions instead of attributes;
- Everybody draws for themselves and gets to describe what happens;
- The GM gets to say whether a description makes sense;
- Everybody, including the GM, has a few tokens to overrule a description;

TBD

## Conflict resolution

There are three possible geometries for a conflict:
1. Balanced.
2. Unbalanced.
3. Desperate.

Balanced conflict:
- each side picks a card;
- if the Excuse (the card without number) is picked by either side:
    - no side gains advantage;
    - discard this card and draw another one for narration purposes
- otherwise
    - highest number means that the side gains advantage;
- each side use their card to narrate how they gain/lose advantage.

If advantage the conflict doesn't deserve a longer narration, it stops
here. Otherwise, it continues as:
- a **Balanced conflict** if the conflict is still balanced; or
- an **Unbalanced Conflict** if one side has gained advantage.

Unbalanced conflict:
- the weakest side picks one card;
- the strongest side picks two cards, keeps the highest number;
- if the Excuse (the card without number) is picked by either side:
    - the strongest side loses the advantage;
    - discard this card and draw another card for narration purposes
- otherwise
    - highest number means that the side gains some/grows advantage;
- each side use their cards to narrate how they gain advantage/
    rebalance the conflict.

If advantage the conflict doesn't deserve a longer narration, it stops
here. Otherwise, it continues as:
- a **Balanced conflict** if the conflict was rebalanced; or
- an **Desperate Conflict** if the strongest side has grown advantage.

Desperate conflict:
- the weakest side picks two card, keeps the lowest number;
- the strongest side picks two cards, keeps the highest number;
- if the Excuse (the card without number) is picked by either side:
    - the strongest side loses some of its advantage;
    - discard this card and draw another card for narration purposes;
- otherwise
    - highest number means that the side gains some advantage/wins;
- each side use their cards to narrate how they win the conflict/
    regain some advantage.

If advantage the conflict doesn't deserve a longer narration, or if the
strongest side won the bout, the conflict stops here. Both sides narrate
its end.

Otherwise, if the conflict was somewhat rebalanced, it continues as a
**Unbalanced conflict**.

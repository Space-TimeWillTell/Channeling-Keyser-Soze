# About this book

As all good things do, this book starts with a story.

It's the story of a Game Master (let's call her Alice), who spent weeks preparing a campaign for her players. Maybe the Players's Characters were to be a company of heroes, who would save the land from a dragon. Or maybe they were students in magics, who were expected to find the sinister secrets of the Sorcerous Highschool. Or maybe they were survivors of a zombie apocalypse, who were to spend each of their days hiding from hordes of shambling undead. But they didn't. Instead of questing for the Magical Dragonsword, the company of heroes actually made a treaty with the dragon, or organized a coup and had the king send all *his* men to look after the item. Instead of looking for the secret passage that would lead them to the Layer of the Monster Under the School, they decided to test the laws of magic, until they blew up the school, or they ran to the teacher, telling her all she needed to know to fix the problem without putting children in harm's way. Instead of waiting for the zombies to come at them, they grabbed a ship, and started a new pirate republic of the seas, or perhaps they decided to go for Cape Kennedy and try to launch their own expedition to the distant Moon Colony.

Hey, Alice, I sympathize, we all do. All of us GMs have been here. And I also have good news for you: that's where the story really starts. Because now you are going to be able to build something even better, without the fear of railroading your players and without the stress of expecting that everything has to be prepared perfectly. Just as importantly, this is an opportunity for everybody to build the campaign *together*.

It's also the story of a Player (let's call him Bob), who had no idea what kind of character he wanted to play. Alice had told him that this game was about vampires, or knights, or space smugglers, but he didn't really think of any reason to pick a story rather than another one, or a specific class, or set of skills. So Bob didn't really have a good time during character creation, and since his character didn't have a reason to be, he didn't have much fun around the table.

Hi, Bob, nice to meet you. Yeah, getting in a setting is tricky and getting in a character is basically impossible if you don't know what you should be in that setting. So this book is for you, too.

**FIXME** More about Bob.

It' also the story of a Writer (let's call her Charline), who had gotten his story started, but didn't have fresh ideas for this antagonist, or that epic fight scene, or simply for finding out what laid behind the door that the hero had finally managed to open.

**FIXME** More about Charline.

Hi Alice, hi Bob, hi Charline. Welcome to *Evil Teaspoons and Inner Minotaurs*. In this book, we'll talk about getting ideas quickly and using them immediately, through techniques of improv. Some of these ideas will come from other players, others will come from the companion Space·Time Deck, and in many cases, you will realize that these are ideas that you already had.

Throughout the book, we'll use the **Space·Time Deck**, a deck of cards loosely inspired from Tarot and designed to aid with improvisation. The techniques we'll show work just as well with other sources of inspiration, including other variants on Tarot. Also, these techniques do not require a specific ruleset – whether you're crunchy, narrative, or not playing at all, you will be able to use what you learn in this book.

**FIXME** More.

## Some vocabulary

While this book is both for role-players and storytellers of all sorts,
we had to pick one vocabulary, and we settled upon role-playing lingo.
Here is a short translation for people who might not be familiar with
that specific vernacular.

- PC: Player Character. In traditional storytelling, that's a *protagonist*.
- NPC: Non-Player Character. In traditional storytelling, that's everybody else:
    - antagonists;
    - supporting characters (also known as "Minor NPCs").
- GM: Game Master. In most role-playing games, the GM is in charge of making sure
    that the story remains consistent, with the help of a ruleset. The GM is also
    in charge of coming up with a plot hook, most plot twists, and plays the Non-
    Player Characters.
- Ruleset/mechanics: The rules used to make sure that the story stays consistent
    with the universe, for instance that human beings don't run faster than racing
    cars, but that long-haired blond elves can surf on shieldes in the middle of a
    battle. In traditional storytelling, things are generally fuzzier, and the
    storyteller needs to rely on sticky notes, intuition and genre cannon. Some
    rulesets are considered "crunchy", if they attempt to simulate a lot of
    aspects of the universe, while others are considered "narrative", if the
    players and GM are expected to rely more on improvisation than on the ruleset
    themselves to ensure consistency.
- Character sheet: A detailed list of abilities, limitations, quirks and motivations
    of a character. In crunchier rulesets, this piece of paper typically
    displays comprehensive numeric information, while in narrative rulesets, it typically
    contains more handwavy descriptions.

# Drawing for ideas

You know what? Let's keep explanations for later. Let's start with some action!

Imagine cars racing in the streets of Ankara. It's the present. Two of the heroes (let's call them Desmond and Erika) share a sportscar, driving as fast as they can away from the HQ of Evil Corporation, where they just stole a USB key. Our third hero (Frank) is in the gadget van, driving more slowly, while looking at a map of traffic lights. A dozen of armed thugs on motorcycles are after Desmond and Erika. Also, imagine you have never visited Ankara, you have no clue what the city looks like, and you haven't prepped this pursuit.

No problem. For one thing, we don't care what the city looks like – it's just a game, and you're not going to get it any more wrong than most Hollywood movies. So let's see what we can do.

## Setting up the scene

First, let's add initial flavour to the encounter. Is it warm? Rainy? Is there a demonstration or a festival today?

Let's ask the Space·Time Deck. Alice draws, declaring "*Let's see what's happening in the streets of Ankara today.*"

On this card, we see:

- A name "XVI. Planning for retirement."
- An interpretation "Being ready, always."
- A picture, with many terracota soldiers.

Looking at the picture and the interpretation, Alice, our GM, now declares "*Apparently, there are many soldiers in the streets. You are not sure why, but it looks like an entire batallion is being redeployed today.*"

Actually, let's go further "*Circulation on the main streets is quite complicated. There are columns of armored vehicles on the avenues and trucks full of young soldiers waiting at the red lights. People don't seem particularly alarmed, so you can only assume that this is either a common occurrence or something that people expected.*"

And since Alice intended to add some flavour, not ruin the pursuit, she adds "*Frank, since you have been here for hours, if you wish, you may have mapped an escape route that avoids the military.*"

With this draw, Alice has gained:
- an overarching threat for both Desmond + Erika and for Frank (let's not get shot by soldiers);
- strategic choices during the pursuit (the PCs could decide to get close to the soldiers, or even to disguise themselves as soldiers and board a truck);
- some background information that may be reused after the pursuit (people were expecting a military redeployment today, why?).

The pursuit may now start. For this, Alice is going to use the usual rules provided by her ruleset, so we're not going to give the details about the pursuit. Don't worry, if you want Space·Time Deck-based rules for the pursuit, either because you're Charlene the writer, or because you just want to try something different, we'll see this [later in this book](total-conversion.md).
